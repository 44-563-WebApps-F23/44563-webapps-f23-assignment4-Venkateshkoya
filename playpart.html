        <h4>Author : Henrik Ibsen</h4>

            <b>HEDDA</b>
            Eilert Lovborg has himself made up his account with life. He has had the
            courage to do--the one right thing. <br> <br>
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            No, you must never think that was how it happened! It must have been in
            delirium that he did it. <br> <br>
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            In despair! <br> <br>
            <b>HEDDA</b>
            That he did not. I am certain of that.  <br> <br>
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            Yes, yes! In delirium! Just as when he tore up our manuscript. <br><br>
            <b>BRACK</b>
            [Starting.] The manuscript? Has he torn that up? <br> <br>
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            Yes, last night. <br><br>
            <b>TESMAN</b>            
            [Whispers softly.] Oh, Hedda, we shall never get over this. <br> <br>         
            <b>BRACK</b>            
            H'm, very extraordinary. <br> <br>
