        <h5>Henrik Ibsen</h5>
        <p>The same rooms at the TESMANS'.  It is evening.  The drawing-
            room is in darkness.  The back room is lighted by the hanging
            lamp over the table.  The curtains over the glass door are
            drawn close.
          
            HEDDA, dressed in black, walks to and fro in the dark room.
            Then she goes into the back room and disappears for a moment
            to the left.  She is heard to strike a few chords on the
            piano.  Presently she comes in sight again, and returns to
            the drawing-room.
          
            BERTA enters from the right, through the inner room, with a
            lighted lamp, which she places on the table in front of the
            corner settee in the drawing-room.  Her eyes are red with
            weeping, and she has black ribbons in her cap.  She goes
            quietly and circumspectly out to the right.  HEDDA goes up
            to the glass door, lifts the curtain a little aside, and
            looks out into the darkness.
          
            Shortly afterwards, MISS TESMAN, in mourning, with a bonnet
            and veil on, comes in from the hall.  HEDDA goes towards her
            and holds out her hand.
            <b>HEDDA</b>

            Eilert Lovborg has himself made up his account with life. He has had the
            courage to do--the one right thing.
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            No, you must never think that was how it happened! It must have been in
            delirium that he did it.
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            In despair!
            
            
            <b>HEDDA</b>
            
            That he did not. I am certain of that.
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Yes, yes! In delirium! Just as when he tore up our manuscript.
            
            
            <b>BRACK</b>
            
            [Starting.] The manuscript? Has he torn that up?
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Yes, last night.
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            [Whispers softly.] Oh, Hedda, we shall never get over this.
            
            
            <b>BRACK</b>
            
            H'm, very extraordinary.
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            [Moving about the room.] To think of Eilert going out of the world
            in this way! And not leaving behind him the book that would have
            immortalised his name--
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Oh, if only it could be put together again!
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            Yes, if it only could! I don't know what I would not give--
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Perhaps it can, Mr. Tesman.
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            What do you mean?
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            [Searches in the pocket of her dress.] Look here. I have kept all the
            loose notes he used to dictate from.
            
            
            <b>HEDDA</b>
            
            [A step forward.] Ah--!
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            You have kept them, Mrs. Elvsted! Eh?
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Yes, I have them here. I put them in my pocket when I left home. Here
            they still are--
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            Oh, do let me see them!
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            [Hands him a bundle of papers.] But they are in such disorder--all mixed
            up.
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            Fancy, if we could make something out of them, after all! Perhaps if we
            two put our heads together--
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Oh yes, at least let us try--
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            We will manage it! We must! I will dedicate my life to this task.
            
            
            <b>HEDDA</b>
            
            You, George? Your life?
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            Yes, or rather all the time I can spare. My own collections must wait in
            the meantime. Hedda--you understand, eh? I owe this to Eilert's memory.
            
            
            <b>HEDDA</b>
            
            Perhaps.
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            And so, my dear Mrs. Elvsted, we will give our whole minds to it. There
            is no use in brooding over what can't be undone--eh? We must try to
            control our grief as much as possible, and--
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Yes, yes, Mr. Tesman, I will do the best I can.
            
            
            <b>TESMAN</b>
            
            Well then, come here. I can't rest until we have looked through the
            notes. Where shall we sit? Here? No, in there, in the back room. Excuse
            me, my dear Judge. Come with me, Mrs. Elvsted.
            
            
            <b>MRS. ELVSTED</b>
            
            Oh, if only it were possible!
            
                 [TESMAN and MRS. ELVSTED go into the back room.  She takes
                   off her hat and cloak.  They both sit at the table under the
                   hanging lamp, and are soon deep in an eager examination of
                   the papers.  HEDDA crosses to the stove and sits in the arm-
                   chair.  Presently BRACK goes up to her.
            
            
            <b>HEDDA</b>
            
            [In a low voice.] Oh, what a sense of freedom it gives one, this act of
            Eilert Lovborg's.
            
            
            <b>BRACK</b>
            
            Freedom, Mrs. Hedda? Well, of course, it is a release for him--</p>
